<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
  <a href="//software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
  by teaching them basic lab skills for computing
  like program design, version control, data management, and task automation.
  This two-day hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools;
  participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
</p>

<!--
    Modify this block to reflect the target audience for your workshop.
    In particular, if it is only open to people from a particular institution,
    or if specialized prerequisite knowledge is required, please mention that.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students, staff, faculty and other 
  researchers. No previous experience with programming is required. If
  you do have experience in the topics in the syllabus and want to help,
  send us an email.

<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
  Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software packages 
  installed in advance (listed below). They are also required to abide by Software Carpentry's
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<p>
We find that workshops go a lot better if people come in groups, e.g., 
4-5 people from one lab, half a dozen from another department or 
institute, etc., so that they are less inhibited about asking 
questions, and can support each other afterwards. So while individual 
sign-ups are welcome, we encourage you to sign-up with a friend!
</p>

<p>
No previous programming skills or experience is required. The lesson 
contents and exercises are aimed at novices.

<h2>Schedule</h2>

<p>
  We are running two full concurrent sessions, one in each room. There 
  are two key differences between the sessions. First is that one 
  will teach programming with and the other will teach programming 
  with R, all the other class content will be the same. As a general 
  guide, Python is for you if you're working in the natural or physical 
  sciences, and if you're in the social sciences and humanities then 
  R might be more valuable. The second difference is that the instructors 
  in the Python session come from the natural and physical sciences, 
  while the instructors in the R session come from the social sciences 
  and humanities. These is just a convenient way to offer the lessons, 
  and of course you're welcome to join whichever session you think will 
  benefit you the most. The choice is completely up to you.
